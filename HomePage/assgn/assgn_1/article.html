			<p>In recent years, the impact of Big Data has spread far and wide across various industries in unexpected ways. It's influence can be seen not only within modern industries, but it has "revolutionized old-school industries" as well. Companies such as Capital One, Rolls Royce, and Walmart are all utilizing Big Data analytics in order to transform their buisnesses. For example, Rolls Royce has successfully use Big Data analytics in their aircraft and engine-manufacturing sector to monitor the hundreds of censors that are stored each of their thousand engines to predict when and where breakdowns may occur.<br>
			Due to Big Data, we have also seen the emergence of a new industry all together. This industry revolves around the collection of large volumes of data combined with the ability to analyze them. This new and valuable piece of information can then be sold for revenue. For example, a private software company called ITA Software gathers flight price data from almost every airline, and combined with Big Data analytics this information can now be used to predict the prices of flights, hotel rooms, popular tourist destinations and more.Over the next several decades, as we continue to generate more and more data, the impact of Big Data analytics and data science will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>

			<p>
				For the music industry, the advent of the internet was seen as a threat as the rates of illegal downloads and streaming began to skyrocket. However, the emergence of Big Data did wonders for the music industry as streaming services such as Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music began to used data analytics to offer listeners a better experience by predicting the what is the best song to play next. With the current streaming models that are available, companies now have access to information such as where, when and how you're listening to what kind of music.<br>
				In addition to this new information about their listeners, streaming services are also able to quantify and analyze individual songs and essentially build a database around it, "Up to 450 data points are collected on every song in its database, currently around 30 million. These include factors such as the gender of the vocalist, the instruments in use, the speed of the rhythm and the style of backing vocals." Tracks are then algorithmically compared with each other, which are then used to decide what the user might want to listen to next. This is what the Musical Genome Project led by Pandora Media aims to do.Besides being able to offer users a more optimal listening experience, Big Data analytics has also been utilized to predict with relative accuracy which positions Pop and Dance records would end up on Billboard charts.<br>
				And what does Taylor Swift have to do with all of this? Well,her concerts have been using Big Data analytics and the Internet of Things to allow users to enjoy gadgets such as LED bracelets controlled through RFID technology that changes colors based on the beat of the music. But of course, we wouldn't expect anything less from Taylor Swift.
